# About

Adds metal-cast throwing axes to the Metalsmith Workshop.
Throwing axes are a deadly high-damage weapon, but cumbersome, so dwarves wont carry many of them. They can be cast from:


* Aluminum
* Copper
* Bronze
* Iron
* Steel
* Silver

The art of accurate axe-throwing is a a carefully guarded secret by the Dwarven Kingdoms, so only dwarves will craft and use throwing axes.

Because of how Dwarf Fortress handles ranged weapons (requiring both a weapon & ammo type) The 'Axe Thrower' is named as "Last Throwing Axe". This is just a flavor-text, so that when a dwarf runs out of throwing axe ammo and enters melee combat, your combat log will readL

> "Urist strikes the goblin with the last throwing axe in the neck, and the part sails off in an arc!"

Functionally the "Last Throwing Axe" is the same as the throwing axes themselves (i.e. a deadly combat axe)
